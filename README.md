# TrafficWatch

**Author**: Jan Haslik (@janhaslik)

TrafficWatch is a real-time traffic monitoring application that utilizes object detection to count vehicles, such as cars and trucks, across multiple cameras to deliver real-time traffic analytics. This system integrates Kafka for streaming data, Java Spring for backend services, React with WebSocket for real-time display, MongoDB for data storage, and OpenCV, Keras, Tensorflow for computer vision tasks.
