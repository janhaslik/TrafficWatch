# TrafficWatch
TrafficWatch is a traffic monitoring application that utilizes real-time object detection to count vehicles, such as cars and trucks, across multiple cameras to deliver real-time traffic analytics. This system integrates Kafka for streaming data, Java Spring for backend services, React with WebSocket for real-time display, MongoDB for data storage, and OpenCV with pretrained models for computer vision tasks.
